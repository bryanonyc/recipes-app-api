# Recipe Finder

Recipe Finder is a project I created to search recipes that users have submitted.  You can access the app as a guest or as a registered user.  Registered users can view, submit, and favorite recipes.  Administorators can review recipes submitted by users and approve the recipe for publishing.  They can also manage users.

The project is divided into two main components: Backend and Frontend.

You can access the app [here.](https://bryano-recipe-finder.onrender.com/)
